# Famicom NROM+Probe

Proxy board for probing Famicom cart signals + NROM mapper with ability to extend.
Actually, there are two separate boards in one:

1. Probing board for logic analyzer / oscilloscope connection
2. Cartridge with NROM mapper and two empty sockets for logic IC (going to run Family Basic there, so there is PRG RAM socket)

## Why
I wanted probing board, but minimum order size for cheap China PCB manufacturers is 5 pcs. Since I don't need 5 probing board, I extended the PCB a little.

## Thanks
